> The bridge between all Autha instances.

Host your own instance
----------------------

> [!TIP]
> You should not host your own instance of `auth-website`.
> (gravitalia.com is already a common bridge between all instances.)

1. Clone repository:
     `git clone https://github.com/Gravitalia/auth-website.git`
3. Open directory:       `cd auth-website`
4. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`

Then, you can use it localy (`pnpm dev`) or deploy it everywhere.
